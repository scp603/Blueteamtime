# harden_ssh.sh - Harden SSH configuration on Debian 13 boxes
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./harden_ssh.sh [--dry-run]
#
# What it does:
#   1. Backs up the current sshd_config before making any changes
#   2. Applies hardened SSH settings via a drop-in config file
#   3. Audits all users' authorized_keys for unrecognized keys
#   4. Restarts sshd to apply changes (skipped in dry-run)
#
# Safety:
#   - Always backs up sshd_config before touching it
#   - Uses a drop-in file in sshd_config.d/ rather than editing sshd_config
#     directly - easier to revert, less risk of corrupting existing config
#   - Validates sshd config before restarting to prevent locking everyone out
#   - AllowUsers is set explicitly - update ALLOWED_USERS before running
#   - Run with --dry-run first to preview all changes
#
# !! READ BEFORE RUNNING !!
#   Populate ALLOWED_USERS and TEAM_PUBKEYS before competition day.
#   Incorrect AllowUsers will lock out legitimate users immediately.
